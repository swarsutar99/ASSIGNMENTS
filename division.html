<h2>A Brief History of C</h2>
<p>C was invented and first implemented by Dennis Ritchie on a DEC PDP-11 that used the Unix
operating system. C is the result of a development process that started with an older language called
BCPL. BCPL was developed by Martin Richards, and it influenced a language called B, which was
invented by Ken Thompson. B led to the development of C in the 1970s.

<h2>C Is a Middle-Level Language</h2>
<p>C is often called a middle-level computer language. This does not mean that C is less powerful,
harder to use, or less developed than a high-level language such as BASIC or Pascal, nor does it
imply that C has the cumbersome nature of assembly language (and its associated troubles). Rather,
C is thought of as a middle-level language because it combines the best elements of high-level
languages with the control and flexibility of assembly language. Table 1-1 shows how C fits into the
spectrum of computer languages.</p>

<h2>C Is a Programmer's Language</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, not all computer programming languages are for programmers. Consider the classic
examples of nonprogrammer languages, COBOL and BASIC. COBOL was designed not to better
the programmer's lot, not to improve the reliability of the code produced, and not even to improve
the speed with which code can be written. Rather, COBOL was designed, in part, to enable
nonprogrammers to read and presumably (however unlikely) to understand the program. BASIC was
created essentially to allow nonprogrammers to program a computer to solve relatively simple
problems.</p>
